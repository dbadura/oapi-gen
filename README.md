# Open API generation tools for Go

Requirements:
- generate model
- generate api which will marshall all bodies
- generate model and api to separate package
- ideal tool would be similar [gqlgen](gqlgen.com/)

## oapi-codegen
[Example code](./internal/oapi-codegen/openapi_server.gen.go) generated by oapi-codegen

Pros:
- generate server and model code. It is able to generate the code to different files.
Cons:
- I wasn't able to split server generated code from generated models , to be able to public models but hide internals
- Doesn't unmarshall body

## [openapi-generator-ci](https://openapi-generator.tech/)

Pros:
- can generate model to seperate files
- the code generated for stub looks like what we'are looking for, in extract parameters, call service and unsmarhsall body, look [here](./internal/server/openaapigenerator/go/api_default.go)
Cons:
- looks like it can generate server stubs only
- generate new project with Dockerfile and etc.

## [kin-openapi](github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/openapi3)

Pros:
- It can be used as a request/response validator, which can be useful. See [example](./cmd/kin/main.go)

Cons:
- it can produce openapi doc by using Go, building the openapi document with it

## [api kit](https://github.com/ExperienceOne/apikit)

Pros:
- a
Cons:
- b

## [goswagger](https://goswagger.io) https://goswagger.io/generate/server.html

Cons:
- Doesn't support version 3 of OpenAPI and probably won't, issues: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1122
